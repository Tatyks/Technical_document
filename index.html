            <p>Accessibility testing is the practice of making your web and mobile apps usable to as many people as possible. It makes apps accessible to those with disabilities, such as vision impairment, hearing disabilities, and other physical or cognitive conditions.

                Often, accessibility testing is not performed in the software development cycle due to a lack of automation, or lower priority.
                
                Accessibility testing is just as important as any other function or performance of an app or website. To make accessibility testing more efficient and sustainable, you need to shift it left and automate it.

                You need accessibility testing to meet the needs of all users. It’s also the law. Between the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Section 508, and the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), you have plenty of regulations to meet. Failure to do so could result in fines of $75,000-$150,000.

                You need to ensure that your apps work with screen readers, speech recognition software, screen magnification, and more. Perfecto can help you eliminate manual non functional testing and accelerate automated accessibility testing.

            <p>You need to test:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Labels — Used by assistive technologies, like VoiceOver or TalkBack.</li>
                <li>Text contrast — Ratio between text or images and background color.</li>
                <li>Hit area size — Area designated for user interaction.</li>
                <li>View hierarchy of UI — Determines how easy the Android app is to navigate.</li>
                <li>Dynamic font size — Option for users to increase font size to fit their needs.</li>
            </ul>

                    Most accessibility tests are done manually or not at all. Many teams outsource accessibility testing to third party services. When it is done, it’s usually not part of the cycle. Accessibility testing is not executed as frequently as it needs to be. This leaves risk for expensive fees and escaped defects.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some dedicated software tools which are used so far to check the Accessibility of the software system.
